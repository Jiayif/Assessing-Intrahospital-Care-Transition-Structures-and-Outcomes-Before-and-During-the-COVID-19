# Assessing-Intrahospital-Care-Transition-Structures-and-Outcomes-Before-and-During-the-COVID-19-Pandemic: Network Analysis


## Background and objective

Transitions of care (TOC) is essential for patients with complex medical needs to maintain the continuity of care. TOC encompasses both the sending and the receiving aspects of the transfer between units within a hospital (intrahospital) or that between home, hospitals, nursing facilities, primary and specialty care offices, long-term care facilities, and residential care settings (interhospital). Both transfers place patients at risk for delays in care, transfers to the wrong departments/facilities, and admission to a unit/facility unable to provide the care the patients need. 

The COVID-19 pandemic may result in unexpected pressure on healthcare organizationsâ€™ routinely work and may burden the TOC system. Meanwhile, trauma patients experienced most transitions during their treatments, and trauma-related hospitalizations bring heavy financial burdens for health care systems in United State (US). We assume if the COVID-19 pandemic has altered the TOC systems, and impacted the subsequent patient outcomes, they should be clearly reflected in the trauma patients. Therefore, to maximize the efficiency of care transition during the pandemic and future care crisis, we wanted to measures the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on intrahospital transfers and length of stay (LOS) of trauma patients, who are affiliated with most intrahospital transfers.

## Dataset
We used a trauma registry repository that was fully anonymized and routinely collected from Vanderbilt University Medical Center (VUMC) between January 2017 and May 2021. To even the scale, we limited patients whose both admission and discharge dates were in the range of March 2019 to March 2020 as pre-COVID-19 patients and those between March 2020 and March 2021 as intra-COVID-19 patients. As a result, we got 3050 and 3392 pre- and intra-COVID-19 patients, respectively.
As it related to patients' privacy, the dataset would not be provided here.
